=head1 SYNOPSIS

                   email     = q{webmaster@example.com},

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple plugin that lets a developer set and forget e-mail links in Catalyst

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 email_page_url

Returns a link in the form of:
mailto:webmaster@example.com?subject=User Report for http://yours.com/ 

The mailto subject is escaped using C<< uri_escape_utf8 >> from
L<URI::Escape> and http://yours.com/ is the current pages uri

=head2 email_page_body

Allows you to e-mail the whole page to someone once you have the right
template. Used the same way as L<email_page_url>

To do.

=head2 email_page_anchor

Allows you to e-mail a page anchor. Used the same way as L<email_page_url>

To do.

=head2 _construct_url

Internal routine.

Reads in the various configuration settings and constructs the mailto
link. See L<CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT>

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 C<< Can't locate Readonly.pm in @INC (@INC contains: >>

L<Readonly> is required

Install it via the usual ways:

    cpan Readonly
    perl -MCPAN -e shell

=head2 C<< Can't locate URI/Escape.pm in @INC (@INC contains: >>

L<URI::Escape> is required. See above for standard way to install

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Catalyst::Plugin::Email::Page requires no configuration files or environment
variables, but you'd best change the C<< mailto >> address.

=head2 Configuring with YAML

Set Configuration to be loaded via Config.yml in YourApp.pm

    use YAML qw(LoadFile);
    use Path::Class 'file';

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        LoadFile(
            file(__PACKAGE__->config->{home}, 'Config.yml')
        )
    );

Settings in Config.yml

    # Email::Page
    email_page:
      email: support@example.com
      subject: Error Report for
      link_text: Report Me

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Readonly>, L<URI::Escape> and of course L<Catalyst>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Initial Bug ID 17248, as reported by CPAN ID DAKKAR

Fixed in version 0.25, which now escapes the mailto subject,
hence the L<URI::Escape> requirement.

Thanks DAKKAR.
